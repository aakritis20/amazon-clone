# JavaScript Explanation
The JavaScript code in this project enhances user interaction by adding dynamic functionality to the MiniAmazon webpage. It enables features such as search functionality, cart updates, smooth scrolling, and menu toggling.

Search Functionality
The search bar allows users to enter a query and click the search button. When clicked, the entered text is retrieved and displayed as an alert message. This mimics a basic search system, which can be later expanded to filter actual products dynamically.
Cart Functionality
Each product box has a "See more" button that acts as an "Add to Cart" function. When clicked, the cart count increases, and the shopping cart icon updates accordingly. A confirmation alert notifies users that an item has been added. This provides a simple way to track selected items.
Smooth Scroll to Top
A "Back to Top" button allows users to quickly navigate to the top of the page. Clicking it triggers a smooth scrolling effect, improving user experience, especially for long pages.
Mobile-Friendly Navigation Toggle
The "All" menu button in the navigation bar enables a toggle effect for the menu options. Clicking the button alternates between showing and hiding additional menu items, making the navigation more responsive and suitable for mobile users.
Conclusion
The JavaScript code enhances interactivity by handling user inputs, updating the UI dynamically, and improving navigation. These features can be further refined by integrating a real search mechanism, persistent cart storage, and improved styling effects for better usability.
